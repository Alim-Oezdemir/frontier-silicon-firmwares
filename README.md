# Firmware exploration - Argon iNet2+

I created this page to document my findings from tinkering with my Argon iNet2+ DAB/FM/Internet radio. I'm not very happy with the firmware provided by Frontier Silicon (the radio is based on a FS2026-5 module), but I lack the knowledge to do anything about it. I hope to give those with the know-how some clues along the way.
